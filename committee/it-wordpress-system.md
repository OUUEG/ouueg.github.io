This page collects some more or less useful notes on the OUUEG WordPress system. **Please note the website infrastructure is being reworked by Marko, so this information may be slightly out of date.**

### Key Themes and Plugins

The key plug-ins we use are:

- **CiviCRM**: our membership database and CRM (customer relationship management)
- **Captcha by BestWebSoft**: ensures every account creation is actually a real one and removes account spamming
- **WordPress Access Control:** to grant committee members access to the backend and CiviCRM.
