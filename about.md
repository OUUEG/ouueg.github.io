The Oxford University Underwater Exploration Group (OUUEG) is a company of around 70 divers – students, staff and alumni of the University of Oxford, as well as people not affiliated with the University.

The club is a recognised [University Sports club ](http://www.sport.ox.ac.uk/student-sport/)of the [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk) and an official branch of the [British Sub-Aqua Club (BSAC)](http://www.bsac.com/).

OUUEG was founded in 1963 and is one of the oldest dive clubs in the UK. The club has a long history of diving all year round all over the UK and abroad.

OUUEG has a lot of active members and offers diving that suits everyone, from beginners to more experienced divers. We teach diving and skills development courses at all levels, organise weekend trips throughout the diving season (mostly to the south coast where our club boat is currently based), as well as longer expeditions to more distant parts of the UK and abroad. New members are always welcome – you don’t need to be at the University to [join us](http://ouueg.com/membership/join/)!

### Equipment

The club is fortunate enough to have enough SCUBA equipment to accommodate even our larger expeditions. All equipment is stored in our kit hut at the Iffley Sports Centre. Club members can hire equipment for their dive trips ([see here for details](https://ouueg.com/diving/club-equipment/)).

### Seahorse – our club boat

The club owns a hard hull boat ‘Seahorse’. It is a 5.8m Tornado RHIB, purchased in 2004, with a Honda 135hp outboard 4-stroke engine, purchased 2014. It is equipped with a GPS/chartplotter, depth sounder and a VHF radio. We always carry full emergency equipment, including oxygen, on board.

For the past few years she has been based in Plymouth and the club offers as much opportunity as possible to dive from her, normally weekend trips and a couple of week-long trips, the legendary Easter Training and Summer Expeditions. If you would like to use her for your trip and there is nothing already planned then get in touch with the boat and diving officers.

Seahorse is a fabulous asset for any dive club, especially a university club, and gives us the flexibility to go where we want when we want. Using the boat adds so much more to diving.
