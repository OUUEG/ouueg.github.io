Scuba diving is an adventure open to anyone aged 12 or over – and with the Oxford University Underwater Exploration Group you found a very affordable way in getting scuba diving lessons. It has never been easier to learn to dive!

All our training is overseen by qualified British Sub Aqua Club (BSAC) instructors. All our instructors are volunteers and it’s thanks to all their efforts that we are still able to offer a wide range of in-club training. BSAC has long been in on the secret of how exciting our seas are to scuba dive. OUUEG’s members have been taking scuba diving lessons and safely diving, exploring and enjoying Britain’s seas (and many other places around the world) for 50 years.

You’ll be in good company, BSAC’s President HRH The Duke of Cambridge is a keen BSAC diver. In the June 2014 issue of SCUBA (BSAC’s member magazine) The Duke wrote: “Just like my grandfather and my father, I am proud to say that I learnt to dive with BSAC, and share your passion for the sport and the underwater world.”

Almost all our training takes place in house. We have access to several quality heated indoor swimming pools with enough depth for basic training and testing kit. Open water training is generally with the clubs’s boat in the diving season or at inland sites like Stoney Cove in the winter. We offer training for all diver grades from [Ocean Diver](/training/learn-to-dive/) for novices, over [Sports Diver](/training/learn-to-dive/) for those wanting to further their skills, to Dive Leader.
