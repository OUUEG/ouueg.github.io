### On Club Trips

The following daily charges apply for club kit on any given diving day.
Exceptions to charges may be made at the discretion of the committee where kit
failed catastrophically without fault of the borrower.

### The Flat Rate

To reduce costs where someone makes heavy use of the club kit, we offer an
annual kit flat rate. The flat rate is aligned with the academic year (beginning
1st October). 

The current annual charge is **£125**. All daily charges are waived,
**except for dry suits**, for which a reduced daily rate applies, as seen in the
table of daily charges above.

The kit flat rate cannot be pro-rated or taken out retroactively. In order for it to be used for a trip, it must be purchased before the trip bill is finalised.

### For The Pool

We don’t charge kit hire for the pool, but we will apply a discretionary charge
of **£2 per pool visit**, to cover gas costs for pool usage. This is on top of any
charges made by OxBSAC for usage of their pool slot at Radley (if applicable).


## OUUEG Boat Rates

We currently charge the following for usage of our club RHIB,
[Seahorse](diving/rhibs.html).

### Daily rate

We charge a daily rate of **£25**, **excluding fuel** for usage of Seahorse.
This includes trips where no diving is done (e.g. boat handling days).
Exceptions are made for dedicated boat handlers on diving trips and instructors
on boat handling courses, for whom the charge is waived.

### Flat rate

We also offer an annual boat flat rate, aligned with the academic year
(beginning 1st October). The current annual rate is **£125**, **excluding fuel**.

The boat flat rate cannot be pro-rated or taken out retroactively. In order for it to be used for a trip, it must be purchased before the trip bill is finalised.

### Fuel Policy

Daily fuel costs are split equally between all members benefiting from boat
usage on a given day. These may be all divers (not boat handlers) on a dive
trip, or all participants of a boat handling excursion. Please note that costs
may be redistributed from instructors to trainees where training occurs.

Seahorse should always be fully refuelled at the end of the trip, and where
possible, a spare jerry can full of fuel should be left aboard. If the tank is
less than 75% full at the end of the trip, the next trip may make use of the
most convenient (and potentially more expensive) refuelling option (usually the
fuel pontoon), and bill the costs to the trip that failed to refuel Seahorse
appropriately.
