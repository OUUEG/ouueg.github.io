We have a full stock of club equipment available for suitably qualified members
to rent! You must be a **current** BSAC + OUUEG member to make use of these
facilities, and either be **qualified** to use the relevant equipment, or currently
**undergoing training with a nationally qualified BSAC instructor**.

## Kit Hut

Our kit hut along with the boat container are located at Iffley road sports
centre. The entrance to the kit hut area is located [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/snsqEpDcnzD452Yj8). To access the kit hut,
an authorized keyholder needs to check out the key from the sports centre
reception. These keyholders are usually committee members and instructors, plus
anyone who has been granted access by the committee. Note that the kit hut may
only be accessed during Sports Centre opening hours, this is a constraint
outside our control.
 
Please treat the kit hut, alongside all the equipment stored there, with
respect. Make sure to leave the hut in an orderly and clean state. It is a
common good from which we all benefit, and the better we treat it, the better
our kit will treat us ðŸ™‚.

If you notice any **broken or malfunctioning kit**, please use [this
form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdeJfw2YqoopWsxZqqGQWE1NzRrJYCkrMaZQfmBwlOel9hChQ/viewform) to report
the issue (select **malfunction** as the type of report), clearly mark the kit (with
a zip tie or similar), and place it on the kit officer's desk (under the
whiteboard). The kit officer will take care of the rest!

Please report any other health and safety hazards directly to the kit officer,
either via text or [kit@ouueg.com](kit@ouueg.com). 

## Borrowing Kit

You may **only** borrow kit for use on club trips. To register a trip as a club
trip, all you need to do is contact the [diving
officer](divingofficer@ouueg.com) and send them an
appropriate risk assessment. If you have never planned a trip, and want help or
guidance with the planning, please contact the [expeditions officer](expedition@ouueg.com) first.

Please check all kit for correct functioning before leaving the kit hut, and
ensure that kit such as cylinders and regulators are still in test / service.

When borrowing any kit, you **must** fill out the [kit checkout form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdIfQ3HcBlp-C77tJKE4Ol9dXZMUdHxCVLjskXURvfjcwpvoA/viewform). On return,
please complete the [kit return form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfiCa6g10t5MFzApkYEqWwkYDHUuppaRFzr4qgjzRjdhhWkcA/viewform). Please ensure that the name on both
forms matches. You can also find all the forms as QR codes on the kit hut pin
board. Trainees should be encouraged to sign out their own kit and not leave it
to the instructor.

You are responsible for any loss or damage sustained to the borrowed kit.
Replacement fees will be based on current replacement costs for a similar item
in similar conditions (e.g. on the second-hand market).

You may borrow one set of kit and two cylinders per person for a given trip.
Only the trip organizer is allowed to take **one** additional set of kit as spares,
where deemed appropriate. Spares taken must also be checked out via the form.

For **pool sessions**, kit does not need to be signed out, but it is the
responsibility of the organizer to ensure all kit is returned clean and to its
correct location.

Please wash kit before returning it to the club, and put everything back into
its place! For specific guidance on how to treat kit, ask your instructor, or
contact the kit officer [kit@ouueg.com](kit@ouueg.com). 

## Kit Hire Charges

We charge a fixed rate for kit on each diving day. Our current charges can be
found here. If you are diving with us more regularly, you might want to consider
taking out our annual kit flat rate!


**In case you have any questions or comments, please donâ€™t hesitate to contact our
Kit Officer at [kit@ouueg.com](kit@ouueg.com).**
