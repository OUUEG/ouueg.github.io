## What happens during a try dive with OUUEG?

A try dive is a fantastic opportunity to get to know the club and its facilities. You arrive at the Iffley Sports Centre and will be greeted by some of the club’s instructors and members. They will introduce you to SCUBA equipment, help you to choose the right sizes and answer all of your questions whilst showing you how to use it.

Fully set-up, you will then get a briefing of some SCUBA fundamentals. We then get you into the pool and you will enjoy a moment every diver remembers – your first breaths underwater! Depending how comfortable you feel we will then have a dive for a while in the pool and potentially even teach you some of the first skills.

A try dive can help you save time and money by finding out in advance if you like diving and if you decide to continue training with OUUEG we even discount your training pack by the cost of your try dive.

## What do I bring?

OUUEG will provide all SCUBA gear. You only have to pack what you typically take to the pool. Please don’t forget to bring:

- Swimwear
- A towel
- An extra T-Shirt or a rash vest to wear underwater
- A £1 coin for the lockers
- A mask, snorkel, and/or fins (if you already own them)
- Sweets or a light snack and enough liquids to stay hydrated

## Are there any restrictions/requirements?

The main requirement for diving is that you do not have any known significant **medical problems**. Anyone with a medical history of diabetes, blackouts (epilepsy, etc.), perforated eardrums, high blood pressure, heart disease, any lung or respiratory disorder, or dependence on drugs may not be able to dive safely. If this is the case, specialist advice must be obtained before contemplating taking up this sport. Please refer to [the BSAC page](https://www.bsac.com/document/try-dive-medical-and-responsibility-declaration-for-potential/) for the latest update.

Another requirement is that you can **swim** and is confident in the water. This means you are comfortable submerging your head, floating on the surface, and moving around in the pool. Swimming ability is important for the safety and enjoyment of scuba diving.

If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to get in touch with our Diving Officer at do@ouueg.com. A declaration form needs to be completed prior to the try dive.
