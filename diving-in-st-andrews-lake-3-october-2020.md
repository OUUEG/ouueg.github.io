As soon as it became possible, three OUUEG divers decided to explore St Andrews Lake — a flooded chalk quarry in Kent (<https://www.standrewsdiving.co.uk/>).

Even better — the rain stopped the moment we arrived. It may already be October, but the water temperature was at comfortable +17° on the surface, although dropping to +8° below 12 m depth.

Each of us did two dives and we saw some underwater attractions — sunken boats, van, and even an airplane.
