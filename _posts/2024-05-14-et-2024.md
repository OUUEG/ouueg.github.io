## David's words

What can I say about ET? It was fantastic and so good to be back at Porthkerris. Even though the drive down on Good Friday was a bit of a beast! The big question though, was would the weather play fair and let us dive? Yes it would and although the surf was a challenge and the vis probably not as good as we’d like, and after being frequently tumbled, we made it safely in and out of the water most day!  We launched seahorse for a successful trip to the wreck of the Volnay and even got some training done! But the weather didn't always play fair and some evenings we were as wet on the beach as we were in the sea! Well some of us were as wet in the sea as we were on the beach! The odd leaky dry suit. The caravans at Kennack Sands were a welcome retreat. Warm, comfortable and a great place to rest, recharge and enjoy some fantastic food. Thank you to all those that fed us so brilliantly. Bellies full and beers or ciders in hand, we chilled out in the evenings as we waited for MC Clara to give us the daily report, in rap! (See below) and some tunes on the guitar from Benjo.

Easter Sunday was a wipe out – but if it's too rough to dive then it must be good enough to surf right? So Rosie called on her ‘surfer dude’ connections and half of use headed to Newquay to catch a wave, while others made fun packed trip to the Seal Sanctuary. A day that ended tastily with a Cornish pasty or two! The end of the week saw more frequent trips to the local – The Potters Bar – with some great folk music. A great lunch at Fat Apples, a cold dip in the sea, a hike or two and a night of sea chanties at Cadwith Cove.

After a great week, tired, smelly and ready for a week of sleep, a few bits of kit lighter we all headed home.

Thank you to everyone that made my ET such fun, diving with such great friends, old and new. Some amazing cooking and fantastic food, amazing company and great laughs. But most of all a huge thanks to Graham our Expeditions Officer for pulling it all together (and towing the boat!), to Kirill for driving the kit van and of course to Captain Haddock for getting the trailer fixed up.

## Clara's Raps

### The no diving day rap

well we woke up and made up our minds <br />
that scuba wasn’t gonna happen this time <br />
and instead of going under <br />
we caught some waves <br />
in the morning there was thunder <br />
then the clouds went away <br />
<br />
everybody stood up <br />
on there two feet <br />
all except david, <br />
face first in pasties. <br />
<br />
after a long day <br />
in the washing machine <br />
we made our way home <br />
for some good cuisine. <br />
<br />
yam, corn, and all things hot <br />
whipping up goodies in a big pot <br />
although the onions weren’t chopped as good <br />
i’m the best slicer in this neighborhood. <br />
<br />
now let’s toss some back <br />
and sing some tunes <br />
beer tastes better underneath the moon. <br />
<br />
we can make our way to the pub <br />
and make some friends <br />
i don’t want this trip <br />
to ever end <br />
<br />
but before it does <br />
hopefully we can get in the water <br />
see some magic <br />
like harry potter <br />
<br />
ouueg is the best indeed <br />
and there’s no place id rather be… <br />

### The rain rap, tap tap

we though the rain went away <br />
but the rain came back <br />
rain rap, rain rap, tap tap <br />
<br />
we made our way down <br />
to porthkerris <br />
for another day <br />
below the surface <br />
<br />
rain in our face <br />
and clouds in the sky <br />
but we got in <br />
without batting an eye <br />
<br />
some spider crabs <br />
sea urchin or two <br />
uncontrolled ascent <br />
washing machine round two <br />
<br />
when we came up <br />
outta the water <br />
the waves took us out <br />
like lambs to the slaughter <br />
<br />
already looking like there’d be no second wave <br />
but kirill and ben went in anyway <br />
<br />
they made their way out and they did not stop <br />
by the time they came up they were <br />
taken to the rocks <br />
<br />
graham and shannon finally made a dive <br />
with superhero tom right by their side <br />
<br />
david then called it <br />
us all drowining on the shore <br />
when he saw mick <br />
drenched down to his core <br />
<br />
so we packed the van then headed back <br />
for some hot tea and sweet little snack <br />
<br />
then rosie wanted to dip her toes in the sea <br />
so along came her, leo, graham ben and me <br />
we all went for a swim in the water <br />
til our toes froze and the shivers startered <br />
<br />
ben had to be saved by some kirill hugs <br />
and we all caught the cold water bugs <br />
<br />
we said by to ben <br />
and the curry pot got hot <br />
hoping for some scuba tomorrow <br />
yeah hopin a lot <br />
<br />
but for now we’ll settle for some night time massages <br />
this is clara’s night time rap <br />
let’s hear some applauses <br />

## And from Leo

The weather may not have been ideal, but diving at Porthkerris Beach was nevertheless tons of fun! Made new friends, sampled new recipes, and enjoyed the water even on the choppiest of days. The anemones, crabs, and urchins more than made up for getting pulverised by the waves. The trip is now forever immortalised in our special stash…
