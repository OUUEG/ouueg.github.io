Even though I have been diving for quite a while, it was my first time diving in
the UK. The members of OUUEG while qualifying me to use a dry suit in a fun and
interactive manner, organized our single day trip to Stoney Cove.

As an international student, naturally I didnâ€™t have any equipment with me in
the UK.  OUUEG helped me days before the dive on what should I bring, what the
expense will be and how the day should go. This gave me confidence and peace of
mind enough to be relaxed and enjoy my dives without any external stresses or
implications due to lack of organization. I will definitely be diving with OUUEG
again!
