Another post-lockdown expedition! Three OUUEG-ers drove down to the beautiful stretch of… pebbles… that is Chesil beach.

The weather was perfect and the sea was almost completely flat. Which is just a well, because getting out of the water, and up the undulating banks of pebbles, can be rather tough. We all had a good laugh at (and sympathy for) Holger trying to climb up the beach with his twin set on.

Personally, I rather enjoyed a fun challenge: my drysuit deflator valve was found to be broken. Letting air out of my wrist seal turned out to be the best way of dumping air with a minimum of getting wet!

Various marine animals were encountered, such as a friendly cuttlefish, a sleeping pipefish, and an absolutely humongous lobster.
