*Tight family of [Conger Conger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_conger)*

These beauties are [conger
eels](https://www.marlin.ac.uk/species/detail/2126), and you can see them on
many dives all around Great Britain. But seeing many of them together is not
that common. Their teeth are sharp â€” don't harass them, or they can bite a chunk
of you off. Otherwise, aren't they lovely? :-)

This Conger of Congers (yes! *Conger* is also one of the the official [collective
nouns](https://thecollectivenouns.com/animals/collective-noun-for-eels/)!) was
spotted on the wreck of [sailing vessel
Avalanche](https://deeperdorset.co.uk/wreck/forest/) South West of Portland Bill.
