OUUEG will be at Oxford University’s 2019 Freshers Fair on Wednesday (9th) and Thursday (10th) of October.

If you’re interested in joining the club or learning how to dive, then come and find us in the North Schools, table number 281.

We’ll also be holding two information evenings where you can find out more about the club, the training we do and the trips we go on. These evenings are open to both divers and those interested in learning to dive. We will hold the sessions on:

Wednesday 23rd October 2019, 7.00-8.00pm , Maddicott Room, Cohen Quad, Walton Street, OX1 2HE

Please come along to find out more about our club and the diving/training we do!
