Tonight, our **pub night** will be at the **Eagle and Child on St Giles**, starting from **20:30.** They have food, so instructors and students won‚Äôt need to starve üòâ

What else is going on with OUUEG?

- This week is going mental with training.  
    We will have **Ocean Diver theory tonight**, starting from 19:15.  
    There will be **three Ocean Diver pool sessions** tomorrow and Saturday and Sunday.  
    Let‚Äôs hope someone will be able to squeeze some ‚Äúreal‚Äù diving in üòâ
- Tonight will be an **info session for already qualified divers new to the club**, were we will discuss ways for crossing over from another agency, and opportunities for further training with OUUEG.  
    We will **meet at 19:00 at IT Services, 13 Banbury Road** ‚Äì please make sure to be on time, as we will have to walk through the door all together. We will leave a phone number outside on the door in case you arrive late.
