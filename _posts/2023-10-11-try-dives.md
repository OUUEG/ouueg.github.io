Our Try Dives last Friday were a huge success!

10 happy Try Divers got to take their first steps on their diving journey:

Huge thanks to all of our instructors for giving up their Friday evening to help out, and a big thanks to Marius for organising the whole thing!

Hope to see lots of fresh faces at **tonight's** (Wednesday 11th October 2023) info evening at 7pm @ Raptakos Seminar Room, St Catherine's College!
