Desperate to catch the dying gasps of summer, the dream team (Alex, Imre, Mateusz and Penny) took off to Swanage for a day of diving. Departing from the kit hut at 8am we were relaxed in the knowledge that our charter boat dive was not departing until 16:30. Dive faff can never be underestimated, however. We arrived in glorious sunshine and by about midday were ready for the first wave of the day – a dive under Swanage pier! The water temp was a toasty 17 degrees, so those in wet suits or leaky drysuits did not suffer too badly, while those in super water tight dry suits like myself were properly poached at the point of finally hitting the water. This classic bimble did not disappoint, with abundant schools of fish and a grumpy wrasse who was obviously accustomed to divers and did not bother moving until I tickled its tail. A pipefish made a special appearance. After a lazy lunch on the pier we departed on Spike for the final highlight of the day – a drift dive around the Old Harry rocks. With the current cracking along at a fair pace, we were carried across mussel beds, more mussel beds, flashing past occasional undulate rays and dog fish. Fish and chips by the seafront made for a satisfying end to a very relaxed and enjoyable day out.
