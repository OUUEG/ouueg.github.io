6 enthusiastic OUUEG-ites set off bright and early from Oxford to drive down to sunny Dorset for some diving at Chesil Beach, with Becca joining us there. The weather was good but the water was a little choppy, making getting in and out of the water on the steep pebbles of Chesil all the more difficult!

Underwater visibility was limited to 2-3m but that didnâ€™t stop some marine life including a pipefish, a playful crab and a catshark from being spotted. The trainees enjoyed some drysuit training; for some of them this was their first open water dives since completing their Ocean Diver Qualification.

We then made the evening return journey back to Oxford in good spirits after a great days diving.
