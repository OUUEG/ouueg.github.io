Slightly rough start to the day with a lot of rain and wind before the first dive which was at roughly 5-7m. Weather and spirits quickly picked up at noon with some sunshine and food and the transition to the second dive went much smoother.

Efficient packing and easy traffic (thanks COVID) led to arriving back at the kit hut before dinner!
