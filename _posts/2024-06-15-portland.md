Bright and early, the morning after finishing term, a big group of us from
OUUEG headed down to Portland for a fun diving trip organized by Karim.

Upon arrival we were greeted by a very choppy ocean and high winds – so our skipper
made the wise decision to call off boat diving for Saturday. However, this
didn't stop us from going out and having three incredible shore dives near
Portland Castle instead. Included was my first night dive – which I loved! This
site was shallow but full of marine life. My favorite encounters were the
nudibranchs, gobies, pipefish, plaice, shrimp and lobsters.

That evening, we went to Portland Bill Lighthouse for an amazing view – and
even saw a group of Manx Shearwaters fly past us. We all loved seeing Pulpit
Rock, which is one of the tourist attractions in the area. It was formed in the
1870s after an arch was cut away by quarrymen, and the leaning slab was added
to give the appearance of an open bible leaning on a pulpit! We stayed in
Portland outdoor center hostel – which was a good location and had a very nice
cafe beneath it where Oscar got the largest English breakfast I have ever seen!

Sunday was calmer and allowed two boat dives at Balaclava Bay, on The Dredger
and then the landing craft! We saw seals, shags and oystercatchers along the
breakwater and David told me all about the unique history of the area. My
highlights included seeing a giant conger eel skeleton, another nudibranch and
a juvenile cuttlefish. We all managed to make it home in good time – with some
very efficient tiding away. The last dive on this trip marked my 20th dive –
hopefully lots more with OUUEG to come!
