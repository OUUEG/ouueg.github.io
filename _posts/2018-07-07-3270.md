OUUEG are back at Chesil Beach and to the Royal Adelaide wreck!

The long walk in across the pebbles is a back breaker, but definitely worth it. Under the waves, Giles and Suzy explore the intact bow section of the wreck – they spot four resident congers, lobsters wandering around with their babies, ballan wrasse, clouds of pollack, a grey gurnard, topknot, red mullet and piles of baby spider craps, and have tompot blenny’s chewing their fingers. All with over 8 meters of visibility. To top it all off, Suzy finishes her Ocean Diver qualification. A brilliant day of diving, and a great achievement for Suzy!
