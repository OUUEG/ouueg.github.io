We always knew that the lockdowns will be over. Maybe not everything has yet returned to complete normal, but organised outdoors sports are now back!

On 2 April 2021 we went (in a socially distancing way!) to the flooded Cromhall Quarry and did the first club dives after months of inactivity. It is important to take it slow — our skills may need to be polished a bit, and our equipment needs a thorough test after staying dry for so long.

Two dives in 8 °C water, in excellent visibility under gentle April sun. We will be back!
