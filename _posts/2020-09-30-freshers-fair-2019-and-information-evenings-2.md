OUUEG will be at Oxford University’s 2020 Freshers Fair on Wednesday (7th) October.

If you’re interested in joining the club or learning how to dive, then come and find us in the virtual fresher’s fair.

We’ll also be holding two information evenings where you can find out more about the club, the training we do and the trips we go on. These evenings are open to both divers and those interested in learning to dive.

Session times:
