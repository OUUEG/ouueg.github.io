On 13-14 August I went on my first expedition with OUUEG. Kirill and I went to dive in Norfolk to see two wrecks of steam ships, sunk at the beginning of the 20th century: SS Vera and SS Rosalie (my favourite!). We also did two drift dives from the shore, and made lots of underwater friends (mostly crabs and lobsters). Altogether, a fantastic little adventure in a jolly good company!

The North Sea can be calm, warm (22°C !!!), and welcoming!
