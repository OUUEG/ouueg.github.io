OUUEG will be at Oxford University’s 2018 Freshers Fair on Wednesday (3rd) and Thursday (4th) of October.

If you’re interested in joining the club or learning how to dive, then come and find us in the North Schools, stall number 244-245.

We’ll also be holding two information evenings where you can find out more about the club, the training we do and the trips we go on. These evenings are open to both divers and those interested in learning to dive. We will hold the sessions on:

Wednesday 10th October 2018, 7.30-8.30pm, University College, 90 High Street Lecture Room

Tuesday 16th October 2018, 7.30-8.30pm, University College, Goodhart Seminar Room

Hope to see you there!
