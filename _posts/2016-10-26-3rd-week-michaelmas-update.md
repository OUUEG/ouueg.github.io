Tonightâ€™s **pub night** will be **from 8:30 onwards at The Royal Oak on Woodstock Road** â€“ they have Burger+Pint deals tonight, so all the new Ocean Diver students and their instructors can be fed and stay happy ðŸ˜‰

So, whatâ€™s going on at the moment on OUUEG?

- **Drysuit courses:** We held a theory session last Thursday, and a first pool session last Friday. If you didnâ€™t make it into the water yet, donâ€™t worry! You will get wet (well, hopefully not ðŸ˜‰ ) soon!
- **Ocean Diver course starts today!** The first theory session will be at the IT services on Banbury road, starting at 7:15pm. For those of you who recently did the Instructor Foundation Course (IFC), the theory sessions are a great way of getting into actual instructing.
- **BSAC Conference**: we had a small delegation attending the BSAC Conference. Tom and Marko can provide you the latest news on upcoming changes to the diver training programme, the latest BSAC incident report, and many other interesting things.
- A bit of **assorted diving in assorted quarries last weekend.** There were two nice wrecks dives on Saturday (one from the 16th century) and two Dive Leader training dives at Chepstow on Sunday.

And, most importantly: this weekend will be OUUEGâ€™s Halloween Trip! Tom is currently organising our trip to Plymouth next weekend â€“ see his email (or Markoâ€™s forward) for details. We can use our own boat there!
