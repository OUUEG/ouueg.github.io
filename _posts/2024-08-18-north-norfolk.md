Diving in the ocean for the first time was simply incredible. An entire other
world exists beneath the waves that works in entirely different ways, and to be
able to visit that world is breathtaking. From the colourful wildlife going
about their business to the remnants of historical wrecks being reclaimed by
nature. Absolutely stunning.

I had felt well prepared coming into it, having completed my training in the
pool sessions and quarry trips to practice the skills necessary to keep myself
and my buddy alive in hostile conditions (if need be), and despite some nerves
everything went (mostly) to plan! Soon after a fresh 5am start, we were walking
down the pebbly beach into a village of crabs among the chalk reef off
Sheringham, Norfolk. Working around the current both in planning and during the
dive was a surprise to me, but our expert instructors ensured it wasn't a
problem and we were able to properly draw in the beauty of our surroundings.

Learning to scuba dive started off as just a crazy “Why not” idea for me, but
thanks to the OUUEG community it has quickly become an obsession. So many
members of the club have offered their time and expertise to teach newbies like
me and share their passion for the wonders of the underwater world. The entire
course has been a damn good time. I’m now looking forward to joining many of the
club trips over the next few years!
