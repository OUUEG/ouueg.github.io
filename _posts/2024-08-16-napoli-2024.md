Our incredible international summer trip saw us fly out to the city of Pozzuoli,
just a 20-minute drive from Naples, sitting atop the super volcano Campi
Flegrei. Our weeklong dive, organised by the wonderful David Brock, saw us dive
with the equally wonderful guides Silvia, Ahmet, Alessandro, Ale and Marcello
from Sub Centro Campi Flegrei amongst the 2000-year-old ruins of part of the
Roman town of Baia, along with dives near the islands of Ischia and Procida.

## Day 1: 26th June

With no diving planned, day 1 served as an opportunity for everyone to arrive in
Naples and spend the day enjoying the fine food and views. Unfortunately, many
of the trip goers suffered some degree of delay, but all bar one unlucky trip
report writer (who’s flight was ultimately cancelled) managed to arrive at a
reasonable time. For those in Naples, it was a quiet evening of enjoying what
would become our local pizzeria, Lucrino’s. For me, a taxi ride from Gatwick to
Luton and a pleasant stay at manor house with 30 peacocks on easyJet’s dime.

A view that unfortunately puts British dive sites to shame. 

## Day 2: 27th June
### Dive 1: Secca delle Fumose

The first dive of the trip was described by David as the “best site within the
archaeological park”.  The site is home to a number of imposing Roman towers and
high levels of volcanic activity meaning there was plenty of opportunity to use
the thermal vents to heat up. The dive is one of the deepest within the park,
however, only sits at a depth of 13m and so served as a nice warm-up dive and
for some the first opportunity to enjoy being under the sea without having to
    use a drysuit. I was fortunate enough to make it over in time to watch the
    group disembark the RIB, with plenty of smiles and stories abound.

### Dive 2: Ninfeo di Claudio

For my first dive we visited perhaps one of the more iconic sites from the park,
Ninfeo di Claudio. The building was constructed in around 40 AD by emperor
Claudius. Throughout the dive we could see the outline of the ancient buildings
and had the unique experience of swimming down a Roman road. In addition to a
number of simple mosaics, at the site are 6 reconstructions of statues that have
since been moved to land for preservation. It was believed the statues resided
in a banquet hall and tell the story of Ulysses and his trickery of the cyclops
Polyphemus. These statues include Ulysses giving Polyphemus the drugged wine,
Dionysus (god of wine) with a panther, Dionysus with an ivy crown, and a statue
of Antonia Minor with a small child.

### Excursion: Monte Nuovo
After a long but incredibly enjoyable first day, we divided up depending on what
we wanted to do most (showering, napping or eating). Myself, Matteo, Jack, Rosie
and Yuya ran over for pizza at Lucrino’s and after which someone had the
incredible idea to climb one of the youngest mountains, Monte Nuovo, immediately
located behind the dive centre. What was initially promised as a 15-minute walk,
resulted in us accidentally taking a turn into a garden, finding an outdoor gym
and having a pit stop at what I have deemed the best water tap in all of Italy.
This took 30 minutes after which we finally reached the start of the trail. The
trek itself wasn’t so bad once we reached the shade, with incredible views down
into the crater that are not done justice by a camera. The evening was spent
eating an excessively large watermelon, eating seafood at Roberta’s and playing
with the hotel’s cat, Cesare.

A quick pit stop where we would quickly learn that neither tomato sauce nor
cheese is guaranteed in Italy.

## Day 2: 28th June
### Dive 3: Solchiaro Procida
Having managed to get a good night’s sleep the day before we began the day
sailing out to Procida island and after a mild bit of current at the surface,
got down and had a relaxed swim along the seabed. Unfortunately, there wasn’t
too much variety in the sea life, but there was a number of pretty fish,
barracudas, sea sponges and (at least for someone not used to diving outside of
British waters) great visibility.

### Dive 4: Terme del Lacus
My second (the group’s third) dive at the archaeological park allowed us to
visit a new site home to a large spa facility built within a home. We were able
to see beautiful multicoloured mosaics that are kept hidden under the dirt to
preserve them, similar building ruins as at Ninfeo di Claudio, alongside a
number of column ruins and evidence etched into the stone showing the site of
doors and of stands to hold umbrellas. Given the size of some of the mosaics, I
felt bad simply waiting for our guide to have to cover them up by herself and so
assisted in moving debris back on – I later learnt I was being honoured by being
allowed to help as she would go on to shoo a couple of other divers off when
they came over to also help.

### Excursion: Castello Aragonese di Baia
After a short rest, we regrouped and took a short bus ride to visit the Baia
castle. The castle as well as boasting easily some of the best views of the
coast, is home to a number of wonderful exhibits outlining the history of the
area. It is also home to the original statues we had observed at the Claudio
Ninfeo. We proceeded to walk into Baia in search of somewhere to eat, eventually
settling on the only open restaurant by the port, allowing us to marvel at the
classic Italian hot dog and chip pizza, and introducing several members to the
joys of the triangle game.

After waiting an hour for a bus due every 10 minutes, we successfully braved the journey home on foot.

## Day 3: 29th June
### Dive 5: San Pancrazio Ischia
For the first dive of the day, we split into 2 groups (above 20m and below 20m).
Having only a handful of dives under my belt following an 8-year hiatus, I opted
to stay below 20m. The rock face is home to a large number of barracuda, breams
and “an absolutely massive octopus” for those who were lucky enough to be at the
back of the group. The group who went to 30m were lucky enough to see a large
number of sea fans, which unfortunately weren’t too prevalent in our location.

### Dive 6: Villa Protiro
One of two dives to Villa Protiro due to it’s enormous site had us immediately
descend on the ruins. Rather amusingly, after only a couple of minutes diving I
watched as another diver dropped to the seafloor and began digging with some
zeal into the floor below. After a few horrified moments of trying to work out
what had possessed a member of OUUEG (and how long we had until they noticed and
tried to deport us all), I realised that the rest of my group was accounted for,
and we were actually watching an archaeologist at work. We moved across the rest
of the site, including being able to view some particularly beautiful and
intricate mosaic patterns across the floor. At the end of the dive we attempted
to take a group photo of us all with the OUUEG banner however this unfortunately
did not go quite according to plan and an already not ideal visibility was made
worse by 14 of us all attempting to congregate around the banner whilst avoiding
hitting any ruins or crashing onto the mosaic.

An attempt was made.

### Excursion: Boating
Ever the boatman, Stefan arranged for an additional boat excursion where most of
the group went to enjoy the surroundings of Ischia. Due to a history with
seasickness, I declined, however my spot was taken by the infamous OUUegg who
given his mucky state at the end of the dive seemed to have had an incredible
time.

## Day 4: 30th June
### Dive 7: Punto Pizzaco Procida
We again returned to Procida, however unlike the previous dives where we had
been able to gently follow the sea wall up and down, the wall was like a cliff
face descending to around 40m. Demonstrating some incredible situational
awareness and buoyancy skills, the group stayed almost perfectly together and at
the 20m mark we had agreed as our maximum. We were again greeted with some
beautiful sealife, though the highlight of this dive was watching as Karim
flicked a clip open and shut in front of an octopus to try and get it’s
attention, only for it to ‘run away’ and earn the ire of a rather small fish who
proceeded to repeatedly ram itself into the poor octopus with about 6 divers all
watching in earnest. Additionally, on this dive we encountered a number of
videographers filming the wildlife along the seawall. With better visibility and
slightly smaller group, we successfully reattempted to get a group photo with
the banner.

Success at last (I’m a lot happier than this picture would otherwise suggest)!

### Dive 8: Villa Protiro
Upon returning to Villa Protiro we perhaps achieved a world first as Stefan
successfully created a dive bell for OUUegg to join us as we traversed the villa
again – truly there is nothing more surreal than watching a man ferry a fury egg
in a water bottle above 2000 year old underwater mosaics as the dive planner
attempts to capture photos. This marked one of the more exciting adventures in
the archaeological park, as we were able to view a number of mosaics, including
dolphins, gladiators fighting, the sun and bird, in addition to watching as our
guide used her regulator to illustrate how the thermal vents would circulate air
across the complex.

### Dive 9: Secca delle Fumose (night)
Marking my first ever night dive, we visited the first dive site of the trip.
Having not seen the site during the day, I admittedly became a little bit
navigationally challenged and ultimately ended the dive having thought there was
only 2 or 3 towers that we had passed by as opposed to the over dozen actually
residing over 10m below the surface. Despite the incredibly overbearing nature
of the towers in the darkness, it was one of the most peaceful dives I’ve done,
with us able to regularly stop to admire the (night)life growing and living
around the buildings.

## Day 5:  1st July
### Dive 10: Ninfeo di Claudio
Unfortunately the site we had originally intended on visiting was not open and
so we were offered the choice of where to go, choosing to return back to the
Claudio Ninfeo. The site was as beautiful as before, however this time we took
the time to slow down, appreciate the view (and take several photos of one
another at the site).

### Dive 11: Secca della Formica (ant reef)
The final dive of the trip, and perhaps one of the most fun, occurred in the
middle of the channel and as we had been informed at the surface, allowed us to
experience temperatures alternating between Italian cold and Italian freezing.
The dive was a first for nearly all of us as we were offered the opportunity to
perform a cavern dive. The start of the dive saw us descended to around 20m
where we swam underneath a beautiful archway, getting to see all the beautiful
flora and fauna we had become accustomed to on the reef alongside it. When we
arrived at the mouth of the cavern, as we had been briefed, we proceeded in
single file, having to swim low to enter and ascending upwards towards the exit.
I was fortunate to have a fabulous buddy in Matteo who (since I didn’t have a
torch) regularly stopped to check that I had enough light to see the route and
also to be able to see the fishes that were swimming further into the cave at
either side of us. As we left, we were greeted with the most beautiful sight as
rays of sunlight passed into the cave. We left one by one, and soon the two
groups merged into a final OUUEG shoal. We finished the rest of the dive by
following along the walls and ascending under another two archways before
returning back to the boat. As the buddy pair at the front of the pack, we would
occasionally turn around and be greeted by the rather incredible site of around
15 divers all following along behind us. We finally made it back to the dive
centre where we posed for one last group photo and thus ended the diving in
Naples.

### Excursion: Descent into (Lake) Avernus and final meal.
At the end of the dive, myself, Rosie, Matteo, Jack, David, Penny and later
Jenny, all made the trip to the formerly much larger volcanic crater lake
Avernus. We successfully avoided falling into Hades and instead go to enjoy a
temple of Apollo and a terrifyingly large number of cats as we slowly melted
from the heat. We made it back in time for our final group meal, as Roy was
leaving a day early, before making a well-earned late-night trip to a bar.

To an Italian it looked like an amphitheatre, to the Brit it looked like a
temple – unfortunately for Matteo 1-0 to England.

Truly the best photo to grace our collection.

## Day 6: 2nd July
As we were unable to fly home for an additional 24 hours from the end of our
final dive, we decided to use the extra day to visit the most famous Roman
ruins, Pompeii. After our bus managed to accidentally cause massive levels of
road chaos, we set off safely. We were all amazed by the absolute scale of the
city, realising almost immediately we didn’t have enough time to see everything.
The group I was in managed to visit some of the most famous sites, including the
amphitheatre, forum, the odeon, various temples, villas with frescos, and
brothel. We returned back for a final outing for pizza and gelato, thus bringing
an end to our trip.

trip save from the cone eater David.
