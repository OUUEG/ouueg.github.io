A key staple of the OUUEG calendar and a highlight of the year is our annual warm-water trip. This year, 11 of us spent a week on a liveaboard, exploring the reefs and wrecks of the northern Red Sea.

Wetsuits out, kit prepped, qualification cards reads

We set off from Oxford on Thursday night, enjoying a late night curry in a hotel by Gatwick airport ready to catch an early flight out on the Friday morning. After landing in Hurghada we were ferried straight onto the liveaboard

Jenny used the opportunity to attempt to finish some work she was meant to submit before leaving for the trip…

Rona demonstrated her excellent trim:

**Day one** – **Shaab el Erg, Giannis D and Abu Nuhas Reef**

We started the day with a gentle reef dive on Shaab el Erg, using this as a chance to check our weight and our kit and to orient ourselves in our new surroundings.

Giannis D – a cargo ship, nearly 100m long, sunk in the Straits of Gubal after running aground in 1983.
