Holger and Penny are hopping across to Ireland,

Dived off Kinsail? Go

- Good setup- huge barge they run the dive operations off and live on it. Compressor and everything
- Load of bunks in bottom of barge. Full board. DOesn’t move from shore
- Only place in that part of Ireland that will take grops just for one or two dives. Otjer place have to book special charters.
- Super nice. Took us out on a big, long black rib. Had the most awesome weather. So Green and fresh there. Every dive had loads of life – Holger photos of 10 different nudibrancs (I thought they were bits of kelp and plastic!), crayfish, huge lobsters, beautfcul jewel anenomies – walls and walls, pike fish, beds of really interesting strawberry anenomies (half read, half white), sponges and soft corals, really good condition dive sites. Lots of light
- Sunken dutch trawler.
- Recommend this operation to go diving with!
- We hired tanks and weights from them
