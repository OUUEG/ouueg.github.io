Dear website admins and committees, I am Frost, working as an IT/Web Officer in 2022. After hand-over with Rocco, and exploring this system in the evening, I plan to summarize my conclusions on this page before I forgot.

Although OUUEG was founded in 1963, our IT: WordPress system was established after nearly half a decade. The earliest post I can find is in May 2006, after a trip to Farnes Island. Starting in 2013, Marko Jung developed a series of pages to make our website more self-contained, attractive, and user-friendly. <meta charset="utf-8"></meta>Marko even tried to deploy a membership database software called CiviCRM and, fortunately, this software has been abundant. So far,

- Our website is hosted on bluehost
- Although the default URL is ouueg.com, we use ouueg.org as a jumper
- To change the role of users, go to Users-&gt;All Users-&gt;Search in wp-admin

An IT system for divers should not be over-complicated – this is my principle in 2022. Think about when you are thrilled to join a dry-suit training, or you are freezing after a wet suit dive, there is no way to get struct in IT staff, and neither does an IT officer! Therefore, I plan to do multiple changes to the website to make it as simple as I can.

- A new package called **Ultimate Member** is installed and activated.
- The login/logout and registration functions are simplified to be one click, anyone can register and share a post immediately.
- Admin/Committees can edit the subscriber’s profile with two clicks. If the date of “Latest Membership Payment” is given, this subscriber and committee will be able to see if he/she is still a club member on the profile page.

Cheers,

Frost
