Scubadiving has a very good track record in terms of safety but it doesn’t happen by chance: good diving practices and paying attention to basic safety guidelines ensure it remains this way.

So in this section you will find the **guidelines you should follow when diving with OUUEG** – if you’ve trained with us hopefully these will be familiar (!) but if you’re coming from a different agency / warm water diving there may be a few things we do differently (e.g. SMBs and DSMBs) that are worth being clear about before heading out.

Remember the club [Diving Officer](http://ouueg.com/contact/ "Contacts") is responsible for members safety and has the final word regarding the decision to dive or not and how to proceed.

## Diving procedures

We follow the BSAC safe diving practices as outlined in the following guide.

[Safe Diving (2014 edition)](http://ouueg.mjung.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/safe_diving_17_02_2014_web.pdf)

Our [Diving Officer](http://ouueg.com/contact/ "Contacts") is ultimately responsible for the safety of all diving and training performed by the club. An overview of individual responsibilities can be found [here](http://ouueg.mjung.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/definition_grid_final_110708.pdf).

Lots of useful information and recommendations on safe diving practices can be found in the [monthly ‘Safety Talk’ bulletin](http://www.bsac.com/page.asp?section=1024&sectionTitle=Safety+Talk+This+Month) published by BSAC.

## Paperwork

To dive with OUUEG you need to be properly insured. Thus, the following formalities need to be observed.

**Club members:**

- You need to be a member of BSAC (for third-party liability cover).
- You need to provide us with a [medical certificate of fitness to dive](http://ouueg.com/medical-certificate/ "Medical certificate"). Certificates are valid for one year and thus need to be re-submitted every year.
- When going abroad, you will be asked to provide proof of a travel/medical insurance that covers recreational scuba diving.

**Non club members:**

- If you’re not a member of BSAC you’re covered by our guest policy for a maximum of 3 days.

## Pool Sessions

Usual: no running pool slide, slippery, etc… pool surfaces can be particularly slippery with fins on!

beyond diving related safety precautions pay attention to what you’re told to do and not to do in the pool such as making sure you’re not putting kit in front of fire exits or carelessly dropping weights onto the tiles…
