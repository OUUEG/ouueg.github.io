One of the exciting opportunities that OUUEG offers is joining on regular dive trips to a variety of fantastic locations – and you can use the [club kit](http://ouueg.com/club-kit/ "Club kit") to rent the gear you need to come along. We dive regularly in the [UK](http://ouueg.com/dive-trips/where-do-we-dive/ "UK diving") throughout the year (alright, less regularly during the winter…) but also organise trips [abroad](http://ouueg.com/dive-trips/abroad-expeditions/ "Abroad expeditions").

All trips are organised by members so if there’s somewhere you’d like to go and check out (wherever it is) feel free to get in touch and to [plan a trip](http://ouueg.com/dive-trips/how-do-i-plan-a-trip/ "How do I plan a trip?")!

To get an idea of what trips are like, check out [reports](http://ouueg.com/dive-trips/dive-reports/ "Dive Reports") from past trips as well as pictures in our [gallery](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ouueg/ "gallery"). For upcoming trips have a look at the [calendar](http://ouueg.com/calendar/ "Calendar").

OUUEG offers boat handling courses and! It is only £10 a dive (which covers maintenance and a fund for the replacement of the boat and the engine – a new hull every 15 years and probably ~2 engines over the lifetime of the hull). Additional to this charge, the costs of the fuel to run it, and any slip fees and/or mooring charges are split between the people on the dive trip.
