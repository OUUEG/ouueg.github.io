If you have any questions about OUUEG do not hesitate to [email our secretary](mailto:ouueg.secretary.com) or anyone from the [club committee](https://ouueg.com/about/committee/) – we are always happy to help and even if we do not know the answer we will find someone who does.

## Mailing list

Most of the club activity is advertised via the mailing list. To join please [click this link](mailto:sympa@maillist.ox.ac.uk?subject=subscribe%20ouueg) to send an email to sympa@maillist.ox.ac.uk with the subject of “subscribe ouueg”. Alternatively if you have an Oxford Single-Sign-On account, you can use the [web interface](https://web.maillist.ox.ac.uk/ox/subscribe/ouueg) to manage your subscription.

To unsubscribe visit the [un-subscription web front-end](https://web.maillist.ox.ac.uk/ox/sigrequest/ouueg) and if that doesn’t work email our [IT Officer](mailto:it-officer@ouueg.com).

## Pub meetings

The best way to get an answer to any questions you might have or discuss diving ideas is to come and have a chat at the pub. We meet every Wednesday at 20:00.

The location is advertised in the mailing list, but you can always email our [social secretary](mailto:social@ouueg.com "Mail our social secretary.") to find out where the next pub meeting will happen.

## Social Media

You can find OUUEG on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ouueg/ "OUUEG on Facebook") and you can follow our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/OUUEG) account. It’s a great way to be reminded of what’s happening soon in the club (be it a pub meeting, a dive trip or a training session) as well as to get your diving fix when you’re stuck in the office and we’re tweeting from wherever we’re at.

## Calendars

Both diving and social activities are put in the [calendar](http://ouueg.com/calendar/ "Calendar") so have a look at it to see what’s already planned.

Please send your contact details to our [membership officer](mailto:membership@ouueg.com) to be added to our low traffic alumni mailings.
