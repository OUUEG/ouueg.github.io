We accept novices and already-qualified divers alike. If you’ve never dived before then check out our [try dives](/training/try). If you’ve qualified with a non-BSAC agency then check out the [cross-over page](/membership/crossing-over).

Regardless, start your underwater adventure by following these three easy steps. Any questions, then [get in contact](/contact).

\[Note\] If you have a problem filling out the form above, please email <ouueg.treasurer@gmail.com>:

- Please CC ouueg.secretary@gmail.com and ouueg.membership@gmail.com
- The subject line should be “NEW MEMBERSHIP \[NAME\] APP”

### 2. Register online with BSAC

In addition to the membership with our club OUUEG, you also need to be a member of BSAC, the national governing body of recreational diving in the United Kingdom.

You can register your BSAC membership on the [BSAC membership website](https://www.bsac.com/membership/) by clicking “*Join via club*” and searching for OUUEG.

**Make sure you fill out the Medical Declaration Form also online during the registration process on [BSAC.com](http://BSAC.com).** **If you answered “yes” to any of the questions, you must seek advice from a medical referee before you dive.**

You may need additional paperwork to dive. Please find more information about this including an up-to-date list of medical referees on the [BSAC Medical Matters pages](http://www.bsac.com/medicalmatters/). You can also [contact our Diving Officer ](mailto:do@ouueg.com)for further info.

But don’t worry – the doctor can certify you as fit for diving unless there is a change in your medical condition. In practice, you’d probably only need to see the referee once and then submit a self-declaration every year alongside that initial certificate authorising you to do so.\[/idea\]

**You are not insured to scuba dive with OUUEG until you provide us with a medical certificate.**

BSAC membership fee is **£33** for Student Members and from **£42** for Full Diving Members. Advanced Divers or Instructors might pay cheaper BSAC rates. Please refer to the BSAC website for accurate information.
