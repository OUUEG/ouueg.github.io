We accept novices and already-qualified divers alike. If you’ve never dived before then check out our [try dives](/diving/try).
If you’ve qualified with a non-BSAC agency then check out the [cross-over page](/membership/crossing-over).

Regardless, start your underwater adventure by following these three easy steps. Any questions, then [get in contact](/about/contact).

#### Membership renewals
OUUEG membership must be renewed annually and runs from 1st of October to 30th of September each year.
To renew your OUUEG membership, you must complete the membership form (step 1) and also renew your BSAC membership (step 2)."

### 1. Register with OUUEG
Fill in the OUUEG Membership Form 2025–26:

### 2. Register with BSAC

In addition to the membership with our club OUUEG, you also need to be a member of BSAC, the national governing body of recreational diving in the United Kingdom.

You can register your BSAC membership on the [BSAC membership website](https://www.bsac.com/membership/) by clicking “*Join via club*” and searching for OUUEG.

**Make sure you fill out the Medical Declaration Form also online during the registration process on [BSAC.com](https://www.bsac.com).** **If you answered “yes” to any of the questions, you must seek advice from a medical referee before you dive.**

You may need additional paperwork to dive. Please find more information about
this including an up-to-date list of medical referees on the [BSAC Medical
Matters pages](http://www.bsac.com/medicalmatters/). You can also [contact our
Diving Officer ](mailto:divingofficer@ouueg.com)for further info.

But don’t worry – the doctor can certify you as fit for diving unless there is a
change in your medical condition. In practice, you’d probably only need to see
the referee once and then submit a self-declaration every year alongside that
initial certificate authorising you to do so.

**You are not insured to scuba dive with OUUEG until you provide us with a medical certificate.**

BSAC membership fee is **£37** for Student Members and from **£68.50** for new
Full Diving Members. Advanced Divers or Instructors might pay cheaper BSAC
rates. Please refer to the BSAC website for accurate information.

If you need help with the process of joining, [OUUEG Membership Secretary](membership@ouueg.com) will be happy to help.
