### 1. Renew your OUUEG membership

OUUEG Student Membership is **£39** and Full Membership is **£72**. If you have a BSAC Instructor Qualification (Assistant OWI or OWI), we offer a **£27** refund after you participate in your first instruction dive in the year (incl. pool/open water).

Pay for your OUUEG membership by transferring the amount to:

- Sort Code: 54-21-23
- Account Number: 24555215
- Account Name: Oxford University Underwater Exploration Group
- Reference: “\[NAME\] MEMBERSHIP APP”

Let the committee know you have joined OUUEG by emailing <ouueg.treasurer@gmail.com> with the subject line “RENEWAL MEMBERSHIP \[NAME\] MEMBERSHIP APP”

### **2. Renew your BSAC membership**

Log on to your membership account on [BSAC.com](http://BSAC.com) and renew your membership there, keeping your club affiliation with OUUEG.

Make sure you fill out the Medical Declaration Form also online during the renewal process on [BSAC.com](http://BSAC.com).

**If you answered “yes” to any of the questions, you must seek advice from a medical referee before you dive.**

You may need additional paperwork to dive. Please find more information about this including an up-to-date list of medical referees at the [BSAC Medical Matters pages](http://www.bsac.com/medicalmatters/). You can also [contact our Diving Officer ](mailto:do@ouueg.com)for further info.

But don’t worry – the doctor can certify you as fit for diving unless there is a change in your medical condition. In practice, you’d probably only need to see the referee once and then submit a self-declaration every year alongside that initial certificate authorising you to do so.
