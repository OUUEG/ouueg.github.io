#### How do I join for the first time?

Joining OUUEG is a very easy three step process. Please find all information on the [join the club page](/membership/join/ "Join us").

#### I’m not a qualified diver. Can I still join?

Yes you can! We run some [try dives](/diving/try) and offer [entry-level training](/training/learn-to-dive) every year.

#### I’m already a qualified diver.

Then come and dive with us! We’re happy to have you.

Note that OUUEG is affiliated with [BSAC](https://www.bsac.com): if you’ve qualified with another agency then you can still dive with us – see the [cross-over page](/membership/crossing-over).

#### What kind of trips do you run?

We tend to go on weekend trips around the UK, either to the coast or in flooded
quarries – usually either every weekend or every other weekend.

We also typically run two or three longer trips every year: the
[Easter trip](/diving/easter-trip) to Cornwall or Portland, and a trip abroad (e.g. the
Egyptian Red Sea in December 2024), and a summer expedition (e.g. Cyprus in July
2025). Please contact our [Expedition Officer](expedition@ouueg.com) for further
information.

#### What are the payment options for membership fees?

OUUEG prefers to receive membership fees via bank transfer. We also have a
physical and virtual card reader that accepts debit cards and credit cards. We
do not accept cheques or cash for membership fees. Please find more information
on the [Join the Club page](/membership/join.html).

BSAC must be paid directly via direct debit (preferred), debit card or credit card.

#### Can you pro-rate my membership?

Please refer to the Membership section of our
[by-laws](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14aEY6qYYriToOg1XskG-pCP80phy85xt/view).
