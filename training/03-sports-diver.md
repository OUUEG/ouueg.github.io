Sports Diver (SD) training is the next big step in your diver training. As a Sports Diver you will develop your skills and advance your theory knowledge. Diving is not just about depth but once you are an SD you can dive down to 35 metres which opens up many new dive sites, especially shipwrecks. This qualification will give you additional skills including important rescue skills and this is also the minimum qualification you need to start training as an instructor which we would highly encourage (and financially support) you to do.

The Sports Diver package contains everything except the open water lessons which you pay for as you go diving on trips with the club.

The initial practical lessons will take place at local Oxford pools with enough depth for basic training. Open water training will take place on a training trip in Michaelmas term and on our Easter Training trip. Costs for the trips such as transport, food and accommodation are not included in the training packages.

If you have any questions about those courses please [contact our training officer](mailto:training@ouueg.com).
