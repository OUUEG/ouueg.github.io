The aim of the dry suit skills development course is to teach the correct and safe techniques for dry suit diving. After the course you should have the confidence to go on your first guided open water dive in a dry suit.

The course consists of two theory lessons which explain physics, equipment, technique, safety procedures and rescue. At OUUEG we typically teach both lessons during an evening theory session. Upon completion of the theory, there are two dives with an instructor – one in sheltered and one in open water. During these dives you will familiarise yourself with the dry suit, learn how to use it, deal with dangerous situations and practice some rescue skills.

We teach dry suit skills as part of our Ocean Diver training. The Dry Suit Skills Development course is aimed at already qualified divers to Ocean Diver level (or equivalent). We would highly recommend for you to participate in a dry suit course if you have never used one before. The BSAC HQ can issue a dry suit certificate (or card) upon successful completion of the course.

The training itself is free to all members of OUUEG, but you will have to cover the associated costs such as transport, kit hire, air fills, and site entrance fees for yourself and your instructor.

Dry Suit training is organised to fit the schedules of both the instructors and trainees, but we cannot guarantee that we will be able to offer you the most convenient dates and times.

If you are interested in learning Dry Suit diving, please email the [Advanced Training Officer](ouueg.ato@google.com).

Please note: we are a club run by volunteers. It would be very much appreciated if you – the aspiring dry suit trainee – help in organising the theory and practical sessions (this may include coordinating it with the instructor and participants, arranging a lecture room, or offering help with transport). We will help you – just get in touch with the [Advanced Training Officer](ouueg.ato@google.com). If you are an active and passionate member of the club, instructors will be much more willing to spend their time teaching you!

In case you have any questions or comments please don’t hesitate to contact our Training Officer at <ouueg.training@google.com>.
